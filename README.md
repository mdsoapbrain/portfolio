## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### Single Cell Multiomics Study in Parkinson's Disease Rat Model, London, UK  
**MSc Dissertation Project** (Advisor: Dr. Sarah Marzi) (03/2023 - 10/2023)  
- Implemented a single nucleus multiomics analysis on a Parkinson's disease rat model using novel sequencing technologies, unearthing disease-specific gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes.  
- Investigated differences in snRNA and snATAC between rotenone-exposed and control rats via our optimized data processing pipeline.  
- Used hdWGCNA for gene co-expression network visualization, identifying regulatory elements with significant differences.  
- Carried out geneset enrichment and trajectory analysis to elucidate key pathways and genes affecting disease progression.  
- Identified candidate Cis-Regulatory Elements, providing deeper insights into the regulation of gene expression in Parkinson's disease.  
- Employed LDSC Regression for estimating SNP heritability, contributing to understanding the genetic influence on Parkinson's disease.

### Single Cell CUT&Tag Study in Alzheimer's Disease, London, UK  
**MSc Rotation Project** (09/2023 - 10/2023)
